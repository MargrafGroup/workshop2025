Martin's presentation

Please install following python libraries
```
pip install ase torch e3nn mace-torch
```
and 
torch-scatter, follow guide at [here](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_scatter). This is maybe not compatible with all python/torch versions, so be aware. If it won't work, hopefully the needed functions will be provided. 

If you won't manage install pytorch_scatter copy functions from scatter_torch_functions.py into your notebook. They are just copied from the repo itself
